      Digital fictions, video-games, interactive narratives, digital poetry/e-poetry, playable stories... collectively, these are works of <a href="https://eliterature.org/">electronic literature</a> (e-lit). I created most of them in Flash. Since the Flash Player is no longer available in most browsers, I have made video screencasts of the Flash works.
