  <h1 class="page-title">About Christine Wilks</h1>

  <p>I'm a digital writer, artist, developer of creative web apps and practice-based researcher.</p>

  <p>As a member of <a href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/writingnewbodies/home?authuser=0">Writing New Bodies</a>, an intercontinental and transdisciplinary research project, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, I am currently creating an interactive digital fiction for body image narrative therapy. It will be published in 2021 as a progressive web app (PWA) for desktop and mobile devices.</p>

  <p>Also as a progressive web app, I'm creating an interactive psychological thriller narrative called <i>Stitched Up</i>. This work-in-progress began life as part of my creative practice-based PhD in Digital Writing at Bath Spa University. During which, I also built an early prototype version of my original interactive narrative engine, the <i>Conversengine</i>, and my custom-built authoring tool, the <i>Convowriter</i>. My PhD thesis is entitled: <i>Stitched Up</i> in The <i>Conversengine</i>: Using Expressive Processing and Multimodal Languages to Create a Character-Driven Interactive Digital Narrative.</p>

  <p>I created the majority of my earlier works of interactive storytelling and playable media in Flash. My digital fiction, <i>Underbelly</i>, won
  the <a href="http://newmediawritingprize.co.uk/?page_id=350">New Media Writing Prize 2010</a> and the
  MaMSIE Digital Media Competition 2011. My work is published in online journals and anthologies, including the
  <a
    href="http://collection.eliterature.org/2/index.html">Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 2</a> and the <a href="http://anthology.elmcip.net/">ELMCIP Anthology of European Electronic Literature</a>,
    and has been presented at international festivals, exhibitions and conferences. You can also see these works in my
    <a [routerLink]="['/elit']">e-lit archive</a>. From 2007 to 2013 I was a core member of the digital arts remixing collective, <a [routerLink]="['/remixworx']">Remixworx</a>, and contributed over 100 remixes. Before working in digital media and web technologies, I made short films, videos, animations, installations and wrote fiction and screenplays.</p>

  <p>I have an MA in Fine Art from Cardiff Institute of Higher Education (UWIC) and an MA(Hons) in Creative Writing and New Media from De Montfort University.</p>

  <p>My creative media & technical skills include:</p>
