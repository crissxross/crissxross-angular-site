      <h2>An interactive digital fiction for body image bibliotherapy</h2>

      <p>Body image concerns affect the well-being of a generation, coming of age immersed in digital culture. <a href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/writingnewbodies">Writing New Body Worlds</a> is a research-creation project, led by Dr Astrid Ensslin, that addresses these issues by developing an interactive digital fiction for body image bibliotherapy. Christine Wilks is the researcher-creator on the transdisciplinary team, responsible for writing, designing and developing the digital fiction, with the critical co-design participation of a group of young women and gender non-binary individuals (aged 18-25) from diverse backgrounds, who are representative of its intended audience.</p>

      <p>The main character of the digital fiction, Hayley, has body image issues relating to her size and shape. This becomes evident from her negative self-talk; she describes herself as fat, flabby and repulsive. And yet, in our interactive text-based fiction, where the reader-player makes choices on Hayley's behalf that can affect her body image, there is no narratorial voice to authoritatively describe her body and none of the characters are ever depicted in mimetic visual form. Therefore Hayley's body is open to interpretation, open to (re)construction. This openness is a deliberate strategy to make the therapeutic benefits and socio-political commitments of the work as fluid and widely accessible as possible.</p>

      <p>Similarly, with audience accessibility in mind, we choose to build the digital fiction on and for the open web platform using a mobile-first, responsive web design approach for the greatest reach. But the affinity between these twin approaches runs deeper. Both the refusal to visually represent a (female-gendered or sexed-coded) body in a digital fiction and the refusal to use proprietary closed platforms represent a form of resistance to the normative forces of cultural hegemony within neoliberalism; not least because the big tech platforms that want to lock us in to proprietary systems are amongst the most prolific purveyors of imagery and messaging that contribute to body dissatisfaction in young people.</p>

      <p>We propose that the specific affordances of a choice-based interactive narrative that situates the reader-player in the mind of the protagonist, may lead to enhanced empathic identification and agency and, therefore, a more profoundly immersive and potentially transformative experience. This process of diegetic enactment is where we postulate the therapeutic value lies via an extradiegetic feedback loop which may induce the reader-player to reflect upon, and perhaps subtly alter, their own body image.</p>
